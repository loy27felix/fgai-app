description: Define reusable environments with stable spatial, lighting, and atmosphere rules.
---

# Purpose

Create pure scene directions that support the script and remain consistent across multiple views.

# Inputs

Use the World Setting, script needs, product use case, explicit scene constraints, and approved scene references.

# Output Guidance

- Render user-visible and audible content in `response_locale`; keep internal controls in English.

- Specify architecture, layout, light, color, atmosphere, and important spatial anchors.
- Keep the environment reusable and open enough for later product and character placement.
- Preserve spatial structure, palette, and lighting across requested viewpoints.
- Separate environment design from characters, actions, and unrelated products.

# Prompt Rules

- Keep spatial anchors and visual continuity explicit across all requested views.

# Do Not

- Do not add people or unrelated products to pure scene references.
- Do not combine conflicting layouts or unrelated environments.
- Do not include provider payloads, local paths, or sibling capability prompts.
