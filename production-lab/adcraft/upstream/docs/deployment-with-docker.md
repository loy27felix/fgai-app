# Deploy AdCraft

This guide starts AdCraft on your own computer. It is written for first-time users: the supplied launcher installs its required runtime when necessary, builds AdCraft, starts it, and prints the local address to open.

If the one-click launcher cannot complete on your computer, use the manual step-by-step section in this guide. It uses the same Docker configuration but lets you run and inspect every stage yourself. If you do not want to use Docker at all, follow the [deployment without Docker guide](deployment-without-docker.md).

## What You Need

- A complete copy of the AdCraft project folder. Keep the folder together; do not run a script from a copied `scripts` folder.
- Internet access for the first deployment, because the launcher may download required components and build images.
- One supported operating system:
  - **Windows:** 64-bit Windows 10 22H2 (build 19045) or later, or 64-bit Windows 11 23H2 (build 22631) or later. Hardware virtualization must be available. Windows Server and Windows containers are not supported.
  - **Linux:** Ubuntu or Debian on a host that can run the Docker Engine service. Other Linux distributions and unprivileged containers are not supported by the first-release launcher.
- On Windows, permission to run a file as an administrator. On Linux, an account that can enter its `sudo` password if the launcher asks.
- API keys from the provider you intend to use. You add them after AdCraft is running; do not put them in a chat message or a public document.

You do **not** need to install Python, Node.js, Docker, or Docker Compose manually. The Windows launcher can set up WSL 2 and Docker Desktop; the Linux launcher can install Docker Engine and its Compose plugin. Those steps need network access and may request administrator or `sudo` permission.

## Before You Start

1. Put the complete project in a local, writable folder. On Windows, a local NTFS folder is the safest choice.
2. Save any work in the folder and make sure the computer has enough disk space for downloaded components and the initial build.
3. Use a trusted personal or work computer. AdCraft will keep API credentials and generated media on this host.
4. Do not manually edit deployment files just to get started. The launcher creates the environment files it needs and chooses an available local port from 8080 through 8179.

The address printed at the end has the form `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`. `127.0.0.1` means this computer only; it is not a public website address.

## Deploy on Windows

1. Open the project folder in File Explorer and open its `scripts` folder.
2. Right-click `scripts\\deploy-windows.cmd` and choose **Run as administrator**. Approve the Windows prompt.
3. On a new machine, the launcher may enable or install WSL 2 and Docker Desktop. Windows may ask you to reboot. If it does, restart Windows, then right-click and run the **same** `scripts\\deploy-windows.cmd` file as administrator again.
4. Wait while the launcher checks the system, prepares its runtime, builds AdCraft, and starts the Agent, API, and Web services. The first run can take longer than later runs.
5. When it reports success, open the printed `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` URL. The launcher normally opens a browser for you; if it does not, copy the displayed URL into a browser on the same computer.

Expected outcome: Agent, API, and Web become healthy and AdCraft opens locally. Docker Desktop must run in **Linux containers** mode. The person deploying is responsible for complying with the applicable Docker Desktop licensing terms.

## Deploy on Linux

1. Open a terminal **in the project folder**.
2. Run this exact command:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/deploy-linux.sh
   ```

3. Enter your `sudo` password **only if the launcher asks for it**. It may need that permission to install or start Docker and supporting system packages. Do not type your API key at a `sudo` prompt.
4. Wait while it checks Ubuntu/Debian, prepares the runtime, builds AdCraft, and waits for the Agent Runtime, API, and Web services to become healthy. The first run can take longer than later runs. If AdCraft is recovering an interrupted video export, the launcher keeps showing service status and waits up to 30 minutes by default.
5. Open the printed `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` URL. On a graphical Linux desktop the launcher may open it automatically; otherwise, copy it into a browser on the same computer.

Expected outcome: the command finishes with a deployment-success message and the local URL. You do not need to install Python, Node.js, Docker, or Docker Compose yourself.

## Change a port after AdCraft is already running

The Docker deployment uses one local Web port and keeps the API on Docker's internal network. The selected Web port is also passed to the backend's credential-origin policy when the containers start. Do not edit the port and restart only the Web container. Stop AdCraft if needed, then rerun the deployment launcher from the project folder; it recreates the matching Web and API configuration while retaining .env, runtime-data, and saved API keys.

## If one-command deployment fails: manual step-by-step deployment

Use this section only when deploy-windows.cmd or deploy-linux.sh cannot finish. Do not run these commands while the one-command launcher is already running.

Use this guide only when `deploy-windows.cmd` or `deploy-linux.sh` cannot finish. It starts the same local-only AdCraft deployment, but you run every stage yourself and can see exactly where a problem occurs.

Do not run the one-click launcher and the commands below at the same time. Keep the complete project folder together. This guide does not install Python, Node.js, or a separate database server.

### What This Deployment Creates

Docker runs three services:

- `agent`: an internal Agent Runtime. It is not published to the computer or the network.
- `api`: the backend on the internal Docker network.
- `web`: the browser interface, published only on `127.0.0.1`.

### 1. Prepare the Project Folder

Put the complete AdCraft folder in a writable local location. Do not copy only the `scripts` folder.

- Windows example: `D:\AdCraft\AdCraft-main`
- Linux example: `~/AdCraft`

Open a terminal in that folder before continuing:

```text
Windows Command Prompt:  cd /d D:\AdCraft\AdCraft-main
Linux terminal:          cd ~/AdCraft
```

Choose a free local port between `8080` and `8179`. This guide uses `8080`. The finished address is `http://127.0.0.1:8080`; it is reachable only from the same computer.

### 2. Install and Start Docker

### Windows 10 or Windows 11

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.
2. Run the following command. Restart Windows if it asks you to do so.

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

3. Download and install Docker Desktop from the [official Docker Desktop for Windows guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/). During installation, select the **WSL 2** backend when prompted.
4. Start Docker Desktop and wait until it reports that the engine is running. It must use **Linux containers**, not Windows containers.
5. Open a new Command Prompt in the AdCraft folder and check Docker:

   ```bat
   docker version
   docker compose version
   ```

   Continue only when both commands succeed and `docker version` shows a Server section.

Docker Desktop licensing is separate from AdCraft; make sure your intended use complies with Docker's applicable terms.

### Ubuntu or Debian Linux

1. Install Docker Engine and the Docker Compose plugin using Docker's official instructions for [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) or [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/). Use the official `apt`-repository method, not an unverified third-party installer.
2. Start Docker and make it start after reboot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now docker
   ```

3. Check Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo docker version
   sudo docker compose version
   ```

   Continue only when both commands succeed. This guide keeps `sudo` in the Linux Docker commands so you do not need to change Docker-group permissions.

If an image pull fails because a corporate network, DNS rule, or proxy blocks Docker registries, fix that network path first. Configure Docker with an approved proxy or registry mirror for your organization, restart Docker, and retry the failed pull. Do not use an unknown public proxy for API keys or production data.

### 3. Create Local Configuration Without Overwriting Existing Keys

The commands below create files only when they are absent. If `apps/api/.env` already exists, it may contain API keys saved from AdCraft, so leave it in place.

### Windows Command Prompt

Run these commands from the project folder:

```bat
if not exist apps\api\.env copy apps\api\.env.example apps\api\.env
if not exist apps\web\.env copy apps\web\.env.example apps\web\.env
if not exist runtime-data mkdir runtime-data
if not exist runtime-data\api mkdir runtime-data\api
if not exist runtime-data\deployment.env (
  >runtime-data\deployment.env echo ADCRAFT_PORT=8080
  >>runtime-data\deployment.env echo ADCRAFT_UID=0
  >>runtime-data\deployment.env echo ADCRAFT_GID=0
)
powershell -NoProfile -Command "$p='runtime-data\deployment.env'; if (-not (Select-String -Quiet -Path $p -Pattern '^ADCRAFT_AGENT_RUNTIME_TOKEN=')) { $b=New-Object byte[] 32; $r=[Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create(); try { $r.GetBytes($b) } finally { $r.Dispose() }; [IO.File]::AppendAllText($p, 'ADCRAFT_AGENT_RUNTIME_TOKEN='+(-join ($b | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString('x2') }))+[Environment]::NewLine) }"
```

The commands create `runtime-data/deployment.env` with the port, Windows container user settings, and a private internal Agent Runtime token. If you chose a port other than `8080`, replace `8080` in the first command before you run it. Keep this file private.

### Linux Terminal

Run these commands from the project folder:

```bash
if [ ! -f apps/api/.env ]; then cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env; chmod 600 apps/api/.env; fi
if [ ! -f apps/web/.env ]; then cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env; chmod 600 apps/web/.env; fi
mkdir -p runtime-data/api
chmod 700 runtime-data runtime-data/api
if [ ! -f runtime-data/deployment.env ]; then
  printf 'ADCRAFT_PORT=8080\nADCRAFT_UID=%s\nADCRAFT_GID=%s\n' "$(id -u)" "$(id -g)" > runtime-data/deployment.env
fi
if ! grep -q '^ADCRAFT_AGENT_RUNTIME_TOKEN=' runtime-data/deployment.env; then
  printf 'ADCRAFT_AGENT_RUNTIME_TOKEN=%s\n' "$(od -An -N32 -tx1 /dev/urandom | tr -d '[:space:]')" >> runtime-data/deployment.env
fi
chmod 600 runtime-data/deployment.env
```

If you chose another port, change `ADCRAFT_PORT=8080` before running the command. Do not copy either `.env.example` file over an existing `.env` file.

### 4. Validate the Compose Configuration

This checks paths and configuration before downloading or building images.

Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
docker compose --env-file runtime-data\deployment.env -f compose.yaml config
```

Linux terminal:

```bash
sudo docker compose --env-file runtime-data/deployment.env -f compose.yaml config
```

Expected result: Docker prints the resolved configuration and exits without an error. If it reports a missing file, return to step 3 and confirm you are in the complete project folder.

### 5. Build the Images

The first build downloads base images and backend/frontend dependencies, so it can take a long time on a slow connection. Keep the terminal open; Docker shows the active build stage and download progress.

Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
docker compose --env-file runtime-data\deployment.env -f compose.yaml build
```

Linux terminal:

```bash
sudo docker compose --env-file runtime-data/deployment.env -f compose.yaml build
```

If Docker reports a registry connection, DNS, or proxy error, the application has not started yet. Correct the Docker network/proxy configuration and rerun this same build command. Do not delete `.env` or `runtime-data/` to solve a network error.

### 6. Start AdCraft

Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
docker compose --env-file runtime-data\deployment.env -f compose.yaml up -d --remove-orphans
```

Linux terminal:

```bash
sudo docker compose --env-file runtime-data/deployment.env -f compose.yaml up -d --remove-orphans
```

Then check the service health.

Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
docker compose --env-file runtime-data\deployment.env -f compose.yaml ps
```

Linux terminal:

```bash
sudo docker compose --env-file runtime-data/deployment.env -f compose.yaml ps
```

Wait until `agent`, `api`, and `web` all show `healthy`. The containers may start in parallel; the API can remain `starting` while it resumes interrupted video exports, so use the health status rather than startup order to decide when AdCraft is ready.

### 7. Open AdCraft and Add API Keys

Open this address in a browser on the same computer:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

If you selected another port, use that port instead. Open **API Space**, enter the provider credentials you intend to use, and choose **Save credentials**. The application saves them locally in `apps/api/.env`; do not paste that file or its values into a chat, issue, or public document.

### Everyday Manual Commands

Run all commands from the project folder. Substitute the Linux `sudo docker` form when you are on Linux.

| Task | Windows Command Prompt | Linux terminal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| View status | `docker compose --env-file runtime-data\deployment.env -f compose.yaml ps` | `sudo docker compose --env-file runtime-data/deployment.env -f compose.yaml ps` |
| Read recent logs | `docker compose --env-file runtime-data\deployment.env -f compose.yaml logs --tail=100 agent api web` | `sudo docker compose --env-file runtime-data/deployment.env -f compose.yaml logs --tail=100 agent api web` |
| Rebuild after replacing project code | `docker compose --env-file runtime-data\deployment.env -f compose.yaml up -d --build --remove-orphans` | `sudo docker compose --env-file runtime-data/deployment.env -f compose.yaml up -d --build --remove-orphans` |
| Stop containers but keep data | `docker compose --env-file runtime-data\deployment.env -f compose.yaml down` | `sudo docker compose --env-file runtime-data/deployment.env -f compose.yaml down` |

Do not use `down -v`, and do not delete `runtime-data/`, unless you intentionally want to remove local deployment state, generated media, and the SQLite event database.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `docker version` does not show a Server section. | Start Docker Desktop on Windows. On Linux, run `sudo systemctl start docker`, then check the command again. |
| `docker compose` is unknown. | Install or update the Docker Compose plugin using Docker's official instructions, then open a new terminal. |
| Linux Docker installation stops during `apt update` because an unrelated repository has no Release file or returns 404. | Disable or correct that broken entry under `/etc/apt/sources.list` or `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`, run `sudo apt update` successfully, then rerun the AdCraft launcher. Do not disable signature verification. |
| `failed to fetch anonymous token`, `EOF`, DNS, or registry timeout. | This is a Docker network/proxy problem, not an AdCraft API-key problem. Correct the Docker Desktop or Linux Docker proxy/DNS path, restart Docker, and retry the build. |
| `port is already allocated`. | Stop the program using the selected port, or edit `ADCRAFT_PORT` in `runtime-data/deployment.env` to another free port from `8080` to `8179`, then run the start command again. |
| `agent`, `api`, or `web` is `exited` or `unhealthy`. | Run the logs command above. Keep API keys and `runtime-data/deployment.env` out of any log excerpt you share. Fix the first reported error, then rerun the rebuild/start command. |
| A rebuild succeeds but the browser still shows old content. | Refresh the browser without cache, then check `docker compose ... ps` and logs to confirm the new containers are running. |

This manual route remains local-only: the web port is bound to `127.0.0.1`. Do not expose it to the network by changing Compose settings unless you have separately designed authentication, TLS, firewall rules, and data protection.

## Open AdCraft and Add API Keys

1. Open the printed local URL and go to **API Space**.
2. Choose an available provider shown in API Space. The page presents the credential fields supported by that provider; enter the keys for the capabilities you plan to use. If the page offers **Use for all**, use it only when the same key is valid for all selected capabilities.
3. Select **Save credentials**. A successful save reports that the credentials were saved and applied, so you do not need to restart AdCraft for that change.
4. If API Space offers a connection test for a configured key, use it to confirm the provider connection. A successful test reports that the connection succeeded, sometimes with the model name.

The keys are stored locally on this host in `apps/api/.env` and are shown in status only in masked form. Treat that file like a password file: do not share it, commit it, attach it to support requests, or paste its contents into a terminal transcript. API usage can incur provider charges; confirm that the key, account, model access, and billing permissions are correct before generating media.

## Everyday Commands

Run these from the project folder when AdCraft has already been deployed.

| What you want to do | Windows PowerShell | Linux terminal | What to expect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Check status | `.\\scripts\\status-windows.ps1` | `bash scripts/status-linux.sh` | The local URL plus API and web health status. |
| Read recent logs | `.\\scripts\\logs-windows.ps1` | `bash scripts/logs-linux.sh` | Up to 100 recent Agent, API, and web log lines. Do not post log lines that contain sensitive information. |
| Stop AdCraft | `.\\scripts\\stop-windows.ps1` | `bash scripts/stop-linux.sh` | Stops the containers while keeping configuration, runtime data, images, and volumes. |
| Start it again or update after replacing project files | Right-click `scripts\\deploy-windows.cmd` and choose **Run as administrator** | `bash scripts/deploy-linux.sh` | Reuses the saved local configuration and prints the local URL again. |

You do not need to run Docker commands yourself. If Windows PowerShell blocks one of the maintenance scripts, open PowerShell as administrator from the project folder and run the displayed command again.

## Keep These Files

- `apps/api/.env` holds backend configuration and the API keys saved in API Space. Keep it private and do not delete it when updating AdCraft.
- `apps/web/.env` holds the web application's local configuration. Keep it with the project.
- `runtime-data/` holds generated media and deployment state, including the selected local port. Do not delete it as part of an update if you want to keep generated work and the saved deployment state.

Stopping AdCraft does not delete these files, images, or volumes. Back up private credentials and valuable generated media using your organization's approved, encrypted backup process before moving or removing the project folder.

## Common Problems

| Problem | What to do | Expected outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows says administrator permission is required. | Right-click `scripts\\deploy-windows.cmd` and choose **Run as administrator**. | The launcher can check prerequisites and continue. |
| Windows enables WSL 2 or asks to restart. | Restart Windows, then run the same `scripts\\deploy-windows.cmd` file as administrator again. | The second run continues with WSL 2 available. |
| Docker Desktop is missing, not ready, or is using Windows containers. | Keep an internet connection, let the launcher finish its setup, start Docker Desktop if prompted, and switch it to Linux containers mode. Then rerun the launcher. | Docker and Docker Compose become available to the launcher. |
| Docker image pulls report `EOF`, an anonymous-token error, or cannot reach `auth.docker.io`. | Keep your proxy client running. In Docker Desktop, open **Settings → Resources → Proxies**, choose manual configuration, and enter only the HTTP/HTTPS proxy URL (for example, `http://127.0.0.1:7890` for a FlClash listener on that address; do not type an `HTTP Proxy:` label). If needed, enable FlClash TUN/global mode and route `docker.io`, `docker.com`, and `dockerusercontent.com` through the proxy. Apply the setting or restart Docker Desktop, then run `docker pull docker/dockerfile:1.7` in Command Prompt. Rerun the launcher only after that command succeeds. | Docker can retrieve the Dockerfile frontend and image layers needed for the build. |
| The Windows version is rejected. | Use 64-bit Windows 10 22H2 build 19045+ or Windows 11 23H2 build 22631+. | The supported-platform check passes. |
| The Linux launcher rejects the operating system. | Use Ubuntu or Debian for this deployment path. | The launcher can determine the supported OS release. |
| A Linux `sudo` prompt appears. | Enter the password for the local account only at that prompt. Do not enter API keys there. | The launcher can install or start required system services. |
| No browser opens after success. | Copy the printed `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` URL into a browser on the same computer. | The local AdCraft page opens. |
| All ports from 8080 through 8179 are in use. | Stop or reconfigure another local program using those ports, then rerun the deployment launcher. | AdCraft can select a free port and print its URL. |
| Deployment reports a health timeout or failed service. | Check status and read the recent logs with the commands above; keep API keys out of anything you share. After resolving the reported local problem, rerun the deployment launcher. | The API and web services report healthy. |
| API Space cannot save or test a key. | Verify the provider key, permissions, billing/quota, model access, and network connection; save the corrected key again. | API Space shows the credential as configured and any available connection test succeeds. |
| A script says required project files or deployment state are missing. | Return to the complete project folder and run the deployment launcher before using status, logs, or stop. | The launcher recreates the required local state. |

## Scope and Safety

- This deployment path is for the supported Windows and Linux desktop systems listed above. It does not configure a public server, remote access, TLS, user accounts, or shared-network access.
- The web port is bound to `127.0.0.1`, so open the printed URL only on the deploying computer. Do not expose it to a network by changing deployment configuration unless you have separately designed and secured that change.
- Keep `apps/api/.env`, `apps/web/.env`, and `runtime-data/` private. They can contain credentials, configuration, deployment state, and generated media.
- The launcher does not change proxy settings or store proxy credentials. Configure proxies only in Docker Desktop or your approved network client.
- Use only API keys and media you are authorized to use. Protect provider accounts, watch provider costs, and follow your organization's data-handling requirements.
- Do not delete environment files or `runtime-data/` to troubleshoot an update unless you have an approved backup and understand that local credentials, generated media, or deployment state may be lost.
