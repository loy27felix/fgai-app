# Seedance 2.5 Runtime Profile

## 1. Authority and Load Condition

Read this file completely only when the active Framewright stage is `Video Prompt` and the target model is Seedance 2.5.

`references/framewright.md` remains the highest authority. This profile may translate an approved Framewright Production Spine and Material Registry into a Seedance 2.5 task route, execution schema, and model-facing prompt. It must not change:

- explicit director locks;
- AUTEUR, APPRENTICE, or SCREENWRITER mode;
- scene grammar;
- Visual Strategy or committed Shot / Phase Spine;
- Storyboard Panel Evidence Plan;
- continuity, performance, sound, or reference-authority contracts;
- active stage;
- generation-unit count or boundaries.

If this profile conflicts with core Framewright, preserve core and report the adapter conflict assistant-facing.

## 2. Runtime Profile

Resolve one task route inside the existing Video Prompt stage:

```yaml
seedance_runtime:
  model: seedance_2_5
  ui_mode: omni_reference | smart_edit | long_video | first_last_frames | extend
  control_profiles:
    - multi_reference
    - multi_keyframe
    - storyboard
    - blockout_coarse
    - blockout_fine
    - seamless_transition
    - marked_edit
    - dialogue_control
    - audio_reference
    - audio_edit
    - subtitle_control
  generation_strategy:
  manual_override:
```

Director mode and `ui_mode` are independent. A task route is model execution syntax, not a new Framewright stage or scene grammar.

Read `generation_strategy`, `prompt_scope_shots`, `reference_allocation`, and any present `edit_use_relationship` from the approved Core Prompt IR. Do not expose those field names in the clean prompt. For `shot_by_shot`, serialize only the active shot; neighboring shot context may protect the incoming state or edit landing but may not contribute its action. For `edited_sequence_single_generation`, preserve every committed cut and retain independent character, location, object, or style references when the sequence needs authority that its Keyframes do not carry. Do not duplicate properties already carried by an admitted Keyframe.

The router may recommend one route and explain the reason in the Run Card. The director may override the recommendation when the requested route is compatible with the supplied materials and target surface. If an override would violate a core lock or lacks required material, ask one compact material question.

## 3. Capability and Feasibility

Seedance 2.5 declares a maximum duration capability of 30 seconds. Treat this only as a ceiling supplied to Framewright's Generation-Unit Feasibility Gate.

Never infer that:

- 30 seconds is the default duration;
- every scene up to 30 seconds is feasible;
- longer capability makes dense action, many cuts, many references, dialogue, or state transitions reliable;
- one unit should be merged to fill the ceiling;
- a unit should split merely because another duration might be easier.

Use the core gate to assess practical action load, cut resets, state progression, performance, reference complexity, dialogue, sound, and continuity. Any split or merge still requires a natural boundary and explicit director approval.

### 3.1 Parameter Provenance and Route Locks

Resolve target-surface parameters in the Run Card, not in the clean Prompt unless a value is itself executable story or framing intent:

```yaml
parameter_contract:
  duration:
    provenance: user_settable | inherited_from_source | platform_locked
    resolved_value:
  aspect_ratio:
    provenance: user_settable | locked_to_source_video | locked_to_first_image
    resolved_value:
```

Route contracts:

- `omni_reference` and `long_video`: duration and aspect ratio are user-settable within verified surface support; duration may not exceed 30 seconds.
- `smart_edit`: aspect ratio is locked to the source video and the surface ratio setting is `adaptive`; duration is platform-locked to the source and the surface duration setting is `-1`. A non-Seedance source may differ by up to about 0.3 seconds because transition frames are compressed; this tolerance is not an editing target.
- `first_last_frames`: aspect ratio is locked to the first-frame image and the surface ratio setting is `adaptive`; first and last images must use the same aspect ratio; duration is user-settable.
- `extend`: aspect ratio is locked to the source video and the surface ratio setting is `adaptive`; extension duration is independently user-settable. MOV input and output are recommended for audio-visual continuity.

Never present a locked field as freely editable. A source-derived value remains a Run Card fact even when it is omitted from the model-facing Prompt.

## 4. Material Registry Bridge

Use the core unified Material Registry as the only source of truth. Each active runtime material resolves:

```yaml
runtime_material:
  material_key:
  media_type: image | video | audio
  native_ref:
  role:
  master_status:
  allowed_authority:
  denied_authority:
  active_stages_or_beats:
  planning_or_runtime_status:
```

Rules:

- Attachment never grants full authority.
- Identity authority does not silently grant source pose, camera, crop, framing, or composition.
- Motion authority does not silently grant identity, environment, final style, or edit-master status.
- Audio timbre authority does not silently grant dialogue text, emotion, accent, pacing, ambience, or music.
- Authority may be local to one shot, phase, or beat.
- Inactive, withheld, planning-only, rejected, and text-extraction-only materials obey core Silent Reference Exclusion.
- Native references are surface bindings for the current run; they do not replace stable core material identity.

Before admission, serialize the result of the core Reference Conditioning Risk Gate as an assistant-facing strategy, not as a second registry:

```yaml
reference_admission_strategy:
  material_key:
  strategy: attach | crop | beat_limited | text_extraction_only | withhold
  active_scope:
  conditioning_risk:
  practical_loss_if_withheld:
  director_decision_required:
```

The adapter may recommend the narrowest strategy, but it must not silently remove, replace, crop, downgrade, or withhold a director-requested runtime material. Ask for a decision when the recommended strategy changes that explicit request. Keep the risk and operator decision in the Run Card; serialize only the resulting active material role and scope into the clean prompt.

### 4.1 Native Material Mention Serialization

Seedance `@` is a structured material-selection operation, not a stable word stored by Framewright.

Resolve three surface forms from the same Material Registry record:

```yaml
surface_binding:
  ui_mention: operator selects the intended uploaded material through @
  text_surrogate: "@Image 1 | @Video 1 | @Audio 1"
  api_binding: provider asset field or asset ID
```

Rules:

- A UI may display a thumbnail, filename, chip, or index after selection. That display does not define material role or authority.
- A `.txt` file cannot preserve the interactive UI chip. It carries the plain-text surrogate, and the Run Card maps that surrogate to the intended file and stable `material_key`.
- An API binding may use a provider-specific ID outside the prompt text. Preserve the same role and authority semantics.
- Do not assume `@Image 1` remains the same physical asset across runs or upload orders.
- Use the native mention itself as the subject when one subject is clear: `@Image 1 crosses the room and stops at the window.`
- With multiple possible subjects, add only a compact disambiguator: `the woman in @Image 1`, `the red vehicle in @Image 2`, or equivalent.
- Avoid padded forms such as `The character from @Image 1` when the mention is already unambiguous.

When active materials need explicit authority, place one compact model-facing block at the start of the clean Prompt:

```text
MATERIAL ROLES
@Image 1: subject identity and wardrobe only; do not inherit source pose, crop, camera, or composition.
@Video 1: phase-2 motion timing only; do not inherit identity, environment, or final style.
@Audio 1: voice timbre only; dialogue text, emotion, accent, and pacing remain separately specified.
```

Include only active runtime materials. Every listed mention must be used, every used mention must be listed or unambiguously bound by its task schema, and all text surrogates count against the character limit.

### 4.2 Target-Surface Material Admission

The current surface accepts at most 50 total reference assets per request, subject to these per-media hard limits:

- images: at most 30, each no larger than 4K;
- videos: at most 10, combined duration no more than 30 seconds;
- audio: at most 10 clips, combined duration no more than 30 seconds.

Exceeding a hard limit is a validation failure. The following are stability recommendations and produce an assistant-facing warning rather than an automatic rejection:

- subject-image references: 1-8 subjects generally work better; 9-12 may require more attempts;
- subject audio/video references: 1-5 subjects generally work better; 6-10 may require more attempts;
- motion or style reference video: 5-10 seconds generally works better;
- Smart Edit source: under 20 seconds generally works better;
- Smart Edit reference images: 1-5 generally work better; 6-8 may require more attempts;
- storyboard grid: 15 panels or fewer generally works better.

The storyboard recommendation does not override core one-generation-unit / one-board authority, silently split a unit, or prohibit an approved board with more than 15 necessary panels. Report the stability risk and preserve the director-approved boundary.

## 5. Task Router

### 5.1 Omni Reference

Use when the task builds a new video from text plus one or more admitted image, video, or audio references and no existing video is the sole editing master.

Common control profiles include `multi_reference`, `multi_keyframe`, `storyboard`, `blockout_coarse`, `blockout_fine`, `dialogue_control`, and `audio_reference`.

### 5.2 Smart Edit

Use when the user wants to change an existing source video while preserving content outside the authorized edit scope.

The source video is the sole editing master. Unless explicitly authorized, preserve its motion, timing, occlusion, event order, environment, identity, camera, and audio. Other materials may guide only the named replacement or edit property.

### 5.3 Long Video

Use when the target surface exposes the long-video route and the approved unit benefits from semantic stages within the 30-second ceiling.

Each stage has one principal state change, a visible entry state, a visible end state, and local reference / dialogue / sound authority. Stages do not create new Framewright generation units and do not bypass the core feasibility gate.

### 5.4 First and Last Frames

Use when the user explicitly assigns first-frame material, last-frame material, or both endpoints.

Endpoint authority controls the assigned boundary only. Resolve the middle motion and state change independently while preserving aspect and composition compatibility. Neither endpoint silently controls every intermediate pose, motion, camera path, or object state.

### 5.5 Extend

Use when an existing source video should continue forward from its actual ending boundary or backward into its actual opening boundary. Resolve `extension_direction: forward | backward` before serialization.

For `forward`, recover the source ending's composition, identity and pose, object and damage state, motion direction and momentum, camera-subject relationship, lighting and environment, room tone, reverb, noise floor, and action-sound continuity. The new segment's first frame continues from that truth.

For `backward`, recover the source opening with the same properties. Describe the preceding action so the new segment's final frame reaches that source first-frame truth. Do not mechanically reverse the forward schema or refer to the source ending.

Both directions require an explicit extension trigger in the clean Prompt, such as `extend forward`, `extend backward`, `continue`, or an equivalent unambiguous instruction. Additional references may supply only admitted attributes and never override the active boundary.

### 5.6 Distinct Boundary Contracts

Core `First-Frame Continuation`, Seedance `First and Last Frames`, and Seedance `Extend` are distinct:

- First-Frame Continuation uses a prior final frame as the next unit's opening anchor for the same shot.
- First and Last Frames uses explicitly assigned endpoint materials for one generation.
- Extend continues from an admitted source video's actual ending state.

Obey the user's explicit assignment. If supplied material could plausibly serve more than one contract and the user is unclear, return to the Intake Hard Stop and ask before freezing the Spine.

## 6. Base Task Schemas

Use exactly one task schema as the serialization owner. Do not combine it with core fallback headings.

### Omni Reference

```text
GENERATION GOAL
MATERIAL ROLES
SHOT OR PHASE PROGRESSION
CONTINUITY + END STATE
AUDIO
NEGATIVE
```

### Smart Edit

```text
EDIT GOAL
SOURCE VIDEO ROLE
TARGET MATERIAL ROLE
EDIT SCOPE
CONTENT TO PRESERVE
AUDIO EDIT POLICY
```

### Long Video

```text
GENERATION GOAL
MATERIAL ROLES
STAGE PLAN
CONTINUITY + END STATE
AUDIO
NEGATIVE
```

### First and Last Frames

```text
FIRST-FRAME AUTHORITY
LAST-FRAME AUTHORITY
MIDDLE MOTION + STATE CHANGE
CONTINUITY + END STATE
AUDIO
NEGATIVE
```

### Extend

```text
EXTENSION DIRECTION + TRIGGER
SOURCE END BOUNDARY (forward) OR SOURCE START BOUNDARY (backward)
CONTINUATION OR PRECEDING ACTION
CAMERA + MOTION CONTINUITY
OBJECT + ENVIRONMENT CONTINUITY
AUDIO CONTINUITY
END STATE
NEGATIVE
```

Omit a heading when it adds no executable value, except Smart Edit must retain explicit edit scope and content-to-preserve language.

### 6.1 Existing Advanced Control Schemas

Use these only when the corresponding already-declared control profile is active.

`multi_keyframe`:

Seedance 2.5's official prompt guide documents ordered multi-keyframes as an advanced reference-driven workflow, not as a separate top-level UI mode and not as a reliability guarantee. Use the `omni_reference` route and bind each independent image to one ordered major state. This workflow is eligible only for Core `single_shot_continuous` strategy or another explicitly continuous process without implied cuts. Do not recommend it merely because several images exist.

```yaml
multi_keyframe_contract:
  ordered_anchors:
    - native_ref:
      state:
      active_stage_or_beat:
      allowed_authority:
      denied_authority:
  progression:
  cuts_implied: false
```

Every anchor is an independent image in declared order and owns only its named major state. An anchor never creates a cut by itself and never authorizes automatic keyframe-image generation.

For `edited_sequence_single_generation`, do not use ordered keyframes to encode shot boundaries; cuts come from the Committed Shot Spine and transition policy. For `shot_by_shot`, admit only Keyframes belonging to the active shot. A full multi-panel Storyboard remains withheld unless the director separately admits it through the Storyboard Runtime Admission contract.

`blockout_coarse` may own approved action paths, blocking, camera path, cut structure, lighting progression, and sound timing. It denies identity, costume, final surface, texture, and visual-style authority; map every geometric stand-in to its final subject or prop.

`blockout_fine` may preserve approved structure, blocking, motion, and camera treatment. Final identity, materials, color, costume, environment finish, and style remain controlled by the Material Registry and director locks; temporary blockout geometry is not identity truth.

`seamless_transition` resolves:

```yaml
seamless_transition_contract:
  before_material:
  after_material:
  trigger:
  camera_path:
  transformation_or_transition:
  arrival_state:
  audio_bridge:
  pixel_identical_preservation_promised: false
```

The clean Prompt carries the executable bridge; the Run Card states that seamless continuity does not promise pixel-identical preservation of both supplied clips. `one-click video` remains an example label, never a route, mode, control profile, or fixture family.

### 6.2 Serialization Procedure

Serialize in this order:

1. exclude the literal Framewright Director Mode label; the Run Card and compile trace retain the one conversation-visible mode;
2. emit `MATERIAL ROLES` only when active references need model-facing role or authority limits;
3. emit exactly one selected task schema;
4. use native mentions directly inside the action, edit, endpoint, continuation, dialogue, or sound clauses they control;
5. serialize relevant operator body path separately from lens target, and carry only the approved opening or persistent motion-state constraints needed by this unit;
6. serialize production-critical physical causality through the shortest visible trigger-to-aftermath chain that preserves topology and load state;
7. run core Compactness, Compression Safety, Silent Reference Exclusion, Runtime Cleanliness, and character-limit validation.

Do not print UI setup, upload order, chip-selection instructions, Run Card fields, rejected materials, or operator reminders in the prompt. The Run Card owns file-to-mention mapping; the clean prompt owns only model-facing semantics.

## 7. Storyboard Runtime Admission

A generated storyboard is planning-only by default. Storyboard generation does not activate `storyboard` control.

Only explicit user admission during Video Prompt routing may choose one of:

- full board;
- selected panel crops;
- selected structural panels;
- multi-keyframes derived from approved panels;
- no storyboard attachment.

Record whether each admitted panel maps to a shot or a phase. Grant only the named structural authority and deny board title, labels, line style, sheet geometry, panel borders, final color, final lighting, final material, and final texture. Panels representing a continuous take never imply cuts, and panel count never becomes video beat count automatically.

## 8. Run Card and Saved Prompt

Return this structure assistant-facing:

```text
RUN CARD
MODE: [Framewright director mode]
TASK / UI MODE: [resolved Seedance route]
CONTROL PROFILES: [active profiles]
DURATION / ASPECT RATIO: [resolved values]
PARAMETER PROVENANCE: [locked, derived, or user-settable]
MATERIALS TO UPLOAD: [active runtime materials]
REFERENCE MAPPING: [material role and limited authority]
GENERATION STRATEGY: [concise operator plan]
KNOWN RISKS: [residual risks]
```

The Run Card is an extension of the core assistant-facing handoff. Do not save `run_card.md` by default.

Save only the clean model-facing `prompt_video.txt` or approved split-unit prompt files. The saved prompt must not contain UI instructions, upload procedure, risk commentary, approval status, rejected materials, workflow explanation, or the Run Card itself.

## 9. Sound and Visible-Text Policy

When the user has not made an explicit sound request, inherit core Framewright unchanged:

- generate scene-appropriate environmental ambience;
- generate synchronized diegetic, practical, and action sound effects;
- do not generate music.

Only an applicable explicit request or recorded production/user grant activates its permitted audio-reference, audio-edit, vocal, subtitle, ambience, SFX, or music policy for the requested scope. A limited brief-vocal grant does not authorize other audio changes. These policies never change director mode, scene grammar, active stage, or generation-unit boundaries.

When explicit sound control or a recorded limited-vocal grant is active, resolve one adapter-local policy without changing the core route:

```yaml
seedance_audio_policy:
  scope:
  source_audio_master:
  dialogue: inherit | preserve | generate_locked_text | replace | remove
  ambience: inherit_core_default | preserve | replace | remove
  sfx: inherit_core_default | preserve | generate | replace | remove
  music: no_music | preserve | generate_explicit_request | replace | remove
  audio_reference_authority:
  subtitle_or_visible_text: none | preserve | generate_locked_text | replace | remove
  vocal_events:
    - event_id:
      event_type: locked_dialogue | authorized_short_response | authorized_nonlexical
      authorization_source:  # added events only; internal, never emitted into the clean prompt
      speaker:
      exact_text:
      nonlexical_description:
      language:
      delivery_authority:
      beat:
      allowed_count:
  silent_reaction_beats:  # legacy silence is strict; new beats may distinguish no_dialogue from strict_no_vocal
```

Rules:

- Do not activate this policy merely because audio material is attached; the user's requested scope controls it.
- Keep dialogue text, speaker, language, and any locked delivery exact. Timbre authority does not grant new wording, emotion, accent, or pacing.
- Give every approved vocal event one speaker, beat, positive count, and exact text with language or a specific nonlexical sound. A new short event needs a current scope grant or recorded preference; serialize the selected event once at its trigger, never as an open invitation to improvise. Use a native mention as speaker only when its identity is unambiguous and actively bound.
- Serialize strict and legacy silent reactions without human vocal events. A `no_dialogue` reaction may carry only the separately authorized nonlexical sound. Do not add a whisper, repeated name, extra speech, subtitle, or visible text to fill silence.
- Map an admitted audio reference with `@Audio n` only to its allowed properties and active beats.
- In Smart Edit, source-video audio remains part of the sole editing master unless the explicit edit scope says preserve, remove, or replace a named component.
- State the environmental bed once. Keep synchronized action SFX in the beat that visibly causes them.
- Music remains `no_music` unless the user explicitly requests music or an explicit Smart Edit operation preserves / replaces existing music.
- Subtitle or visible-text control uses exact locked text, language, placement purpose, and persistence only when requested. Do not invent subtitles from unstated dialogue.
- Preserve room tone, reverb, noise floor, and action-sound continuity across Extend unless the user explicitly requests an audio change.

Use concise markers only when they improve task execution:

```text
DIALOGUE:
AMBIENCE:
SFX:
MUSIC:
SUBTITLE / VISIBLE TEXT:
```

Omit inactive markers. Never add an empty `MUSIC` block to a default no-music prompt when one compact no-music instruction is sufficient.

When explicitly requested, Seedance-specific serialization uses the current guide's compact syntax: music in `(...)`, a discrete SFX event in `<...>`, spoken dialogue in `{...}`, and deliberately requested visible subtitle text in `■■...■■`. For non-Chinese dialogue, also state speaker, language, accent when material, and delivery. These marks serialize an already approved sound or text scope; they never create one. Negative controls such as `no BGM`, `no subtitles`, or removal of a named audio component remain valid when requested.

The exact special-glyph mapping is snapshot-qualified from the reconciled Prompt Guide because the current Lark page confirmed the special-syntax section but did not provide a fresh native export. Preserve this evidence grade assistant-facing; never substitute invented punctuation.

### 9.1 Conditional Numeric Timing

Semantic timing remains the default. Use integer-second timestamps only for a Long Video pacing plan, a user-requested critical exact moment, required dialogue/audio/edit/action synchronization, or another selected technique that needs numeric ranges.

When numeric timing is active:

- ranges are consecutive, non-overlapping, and within resolved duration;
- each critical point has a visible or audible trigger;
- each production-critical camera event states the camera instruction;
- any state that must continue after the event is explicitly preserved;
- impossible action density becomes a feasibility risk, not a fabricated exact guarantee.

Do not rewrite an ordinary scene into second-by-second timing automatically. Timestamps allocate pacing and are not frame-accurate edit guarantees.

### 9.2 Typography and Frame Accuracy

When critical typography, formulas, signage, subtitle layout, or frame-accurate timing matters, the Run Card or handoff states the Prompt-only reliability boundary and recommends a prepared asset, locked reference, or post-production route. The user may still ask the model to attempt it. Keep this limitation assistant-facing unless a concrete visible constraint is executable in the Prompt.

### 9.3 Compactness Qualification

Retain the 10,000-character hard ceiling. Passing it is necessary, not sufficient: record character count, active-material count, stage count, and preserved semantic anchors for representative routes; reject duplicated instructions, inactive blocks, assistant-facing leakage, and low-value headings. Compression must preserve identity, state, boundary, reference authority, camera causality, material performance stimulus-to-aftermath, exact dialogue and authorized vocal-event count, and explicit negatives.

When a complete clean English candidate still exceeds the ceiling, apply Core's Lossless Chinese Overflow Re-serialization before deleting active content. Re-express every natural-language schema value in concise Chinese from the approved Prompt IR. Preserve task headings, `@Image N` / `@Video N` / `@Audio N`, special audio or subtitle symbols, proper names marked exact, exact approved dialogue or visible text, numbers, and route literals byte-for-byte. Use the Chinese candidate only when semantic anchors and protected literals match and the complete prompt fits. If it still exceeds the ceiling, resume Core Compression Safety without silently changing structure or reference authority.

## 10. Advanced Task Feasibility

Before serialization, verify route prerequisites and target-surface support:

- Omni Reference has every material required by the selected control profiles.
- Smart Edit has exactly one admitted source-video editing master and a bounded edit scope.
- Long Video remains within the declared 30-second ceiling and its stages do not conceal overloaded cuts, references, dialogue, or state changes.
- First and Last Frames has explicit endpoint assignments and compatible requested aspect / composition logic.
- Extend has an admitted source video, explicit direction, and the correct recoverable ending boundary for forward or opening boundary for backward.
- Multi-keyframe anchors have an explicit order and state mapping without implied cuts.
- Coarse and fine blockouts stay within their distinct authority boundaries.
- Seamless transition has a trigger, camera path, arrival state, and audio bridge.
- Storyboard control has explicit runtime admission and limited structural authority.
- Every admitted reference passed the core conditioning-risk gate; any strategy that changes a director-requested attachment has explicit approval.
- Audio and subtitle control has an explicit requested scope; dialogue is locked by the director or a narrowly authorized brief-vocal grant as defined by Core.
- Explicit or recorded limited vocal control has unique event ownership, exact event count, and strict or scoped silent-reaction boundaries.

If a required material or assignment is missing, ask one compact Intake question. Do not switch routes silently. If the route is valid but execution remains dense, return to the core Generation-Unit Feasibility Gate; never auto-split or auto-merge.

Count the final plain-text prompt, including material-role declarations, native mention surrogates, dialogue, audio cues, negatives, spaces, and line breaks. UI chip rendering does not excuse an over-limit `.txt` artifact.

## 11. Generation Evidence and Repair

Prompt compilation never starts a generation. When generation is separately authorized and a result exists, extend the core assistant-facing evidence record with:

```yaml
seedance_generation_evidence:
  target_surface:
  profile_version:
  task_route:
  control_profiles:
  surface_binding_map:
  source_master_check:
  duration_and_aspect:
  prompt_fingerprint:
  attempt_index:
  retry_or_credit_cost:
  observed_result:
  primary_failure_layer:
  scene_local_repair:
  evidence_status:
```

Use one primary failure layer:

```text
planning
serialization
rendering
reference_authority
runtime_or_surface
model_behavior
```

Repair the smallest affected scope. Examples: correct one material binding for a reference-authority failure; rewrite one task clause for a serialization failure; revise the Shot / Phase or feasibility plan only for a demonstrated planning failure. Do not use prompt wording to pretend a runtime outage or model limitation is a planning defect.

One successful generation is scene-local evidence, not a global adapter rule. A retry or regeneration requires its own applicable authorization and should record attempt and cost when known.

## 12. Runtime Validation

Before saving, verify:

- exactly one task route and one serialization owner are active;
- director mode, scene grammar, stage, and generation-unit boundaries are unchanged;
- the 30-second ceiling was not used as default duration or feasibility proof;
- the director's route override was honored when valid;
- parameter provenance matches the selected route and no locked value is presented as user-settable;
- hard material limits pass; stable-range excess is disclosed as a warning rather than a false platform rejection;
- each active material has limited allowed and denied authority;
- every text surrogate maps to the intended file and stable Material Registry role; UI labels and upload order do not define authority;
- every listed native mention is used and every used mention is mapped;
- unambiguous single-subject mentions are not padded, while ambiguous multi-subject mentions are compactly qualified;
- Smart Edit has exactly one source-video editing master and preserves all unedited content;
- first-frame, last-frame, both-endpoint, and Extend assignments are explicit;
- forward and backward Extend use the correct source boundary and an unambiguous trigger;
- storyboard material is absent unless explicitly admitted for Video Prompt runtime;
- continuous-take phases remain phases, not cuts;
- relevant operator body path remains distinct from lens target, and opening-only motion constraints are not incorrectly made persistent;
- cross-unit motion continuity inherits only approved Spine state or a director-selected take;
- production-critical physical chains preserve required contact, settling, part provenance, and load state without generic topology blocks;
- inactive materials and UI instructions do not enter the prompt;
- reference conditioning strategy is disclosed assistant-facing, and no director-requested runtime material is silently removed, replaced, cropped, downgraded, or withheld;
- unspecified sound inherits ambience plus synchronized diegetic/action SFX and no music;
- explicit dialogue, audio, music, SFX, and subtitle policies affect only their requested scope;
- each approved vocal event appears only for its speaker, text, beat, and allowed count; silent reactions do not acquire extra speech or visible text;
- the Run Card remains assistant-facing and the clean prompt is saved;
- generation evidence is recorded only after separately authorized generation and does not promote one result into a global rule;
- core timing, sound, continuity, performance, compression, and character-limit checks pass.
