# Framewright

Use Framewright as a director-steered, intent-preserving cinematic compiler whose primary executable output is a prompt artifact for AI filmmaking pre-production.

## Authoritative reference and efficient loading

Treat `references/framewright.md` as the authoritative specification, including its unified intake, stage routing, director modes, asset handling, continuity rules, and output contracts. At the first Framewright action in a task, read its frontmatter and section map, then read every section that governs the current scope, mode, stage, materials, continuity, output, and validation. Do not replace this source with a remembered or lossy summary.

Within the same uncompacted conversation context, reuse an already loaded section when the exact Core version and relevant scope are unchanged. Do not mechanically re-read unchanged sources at the approval-to-compile boundary. If the task is new, context was compacted, the Core version changed, the scope or stage changed, or a source-of-truth conflict appears, restore the missing authoritative sections before continuing; expand to a complete reread whenever selective restoration cannot prove the applicable rule. This is a loading optimization, never permission to omit a relevant rule.

For Video Prompt, first compile the approved Production Spine into the model-neutral Prompt IR defined by the authoritative reference. Then read `references/runtime_profiles/adapter_registry.yaml`, resolve exactly one registered target-model / serialization-owner pair, and read exactly that model's subordinate runtime profile completely before its first feasibility qualification or serialization in the current uncompacted context:

- Seedance 2.0: `references/runtime_profiles/seedance_2_0.md`
- Seedance 2.5: `references/runtime_profiles/seedance_2_5.md`
- MiniMax H3: `references/runtime_profiles/minimax_h3.md`

Do not infer a target model from supplied media, prompt style, platform, provider, surface, or profile availability. Target model—not platform—selects the dialect. Load exactly one adapter profile for exactly one target. If the requested target is unsupported or ambiguous, ask one compact target-model question. An adapter may qualify feasibility and serialize the approved Prompt IR, but it may not reinterpret creative intent, modify the IR, or override the authoritative reference, director locks, state, stage, or compiler ownership.

Reuse that fully loaded adapter for later compiles in the same uncompacted context only while its exact profile version, target, route prerequisites, and relevant scope remain unchanged. Reload it after compaction, a profile-version change, a target change, or an adapter conflict. Never load all adapters as a precaution.

For Storyboard, Shot Plate, or Keyframe work, first read `references/keyframe_profiles/adapter_registry.yaml`, resolve the artifact kind and operation, and read only the registered profile that owns that route. Midjourney V8.2 is the default creator for Shot Plates and Keyframes. GPT Image 2.5 is the default Storyboard creator and may create a Shot Plate or Keyframe only when the director explicitly selects it. GPT Image 2.5 is the sole registered editor for Storyboards, Shot Plates, and Keyframes. When the surface exposes an implementation-model selector, its adapter defaults to Sunburst for fidelity-sensitive work; use Flare only after an explicit speed-priority instruction. Do not claim either API model when the active surface manages ChatGPT Images 2.5 without exposing that choice. Core owns artifact purpose, board or frozen-image structure, shot scope, look contract, continuity, and reference authority; the selected profile owns only model-facing image serialization and its Run Card. Never route to GPT Image 2, Midjourney V7, or a Midjourney Edit Model adapter.

Framewright is the exclusive compiler whenever the user explicitly invokes Framewright. Do not treat another installed model-prompt skill as an implicit compiler source and do not merge its rules into the active Framewright compile. A separately requested comparison may remain outside the clean artifact and must not change the active serialization owner.

That selection remains active for follow-up advice, local revisions, and troubleshooting in the same work. Selecting a Seedance target does not select the external Seedance skill. If earlier conversation loaded external prompt rules, re-anchor the current task to the approved Spine, Core, and selected adapter; do not carry those external defaults forward as authority.

## Integrated craft references

Framewright includes its own camera, motion, character/reference, lighting, sound, prompt-expression, and repair guidance. Use these subordinate references when the current task needs them; no external Seedance installation or sub-skill invocation is required.

| Current need | Read |
|---|---|
| Combined camera/body movement, ordinary dialogue or listening, emotional transition, secondary motion, or performance timing; material still-frame viewpoint, scale, crop or focus conflict | [Camera and motion](references/craft/camera-motion.md) |
| Asymmetric identity, reference-role conflict, local image revision, hairstyle state or material fidelity | [Identity and material](references/craft/identity-material.md) |
| Light-zone changes, material still-frame subject lighting or exposure, cue timing, authorized brief vocal events, strict silence or unwanted sound | [Light and sound](references/craft/light-sound.md) |
| Failed or partly usable generation; choosing the smallest repair | [Diagnosis and repair](references/craft/diagnosis-repair.md) |

Load only the relevant reference or section; reuse it in the same context when unchanged. Ordinary dialogue, listening, or material emotional change is enough to load the applicable performance guidance; no action failure is needed. Core owns the decisions and the existing records, and exactly one target adapter owns serialization. These references add no stages, default files, model limits, generation permissions, or mandatory creative questionnaire. They cannot shorten locked dialogue, simplify approved action, replace deliberate silence, enforce a palette, or split a shot without the existing director authority.

For Video Prompt validation, supply `--compiler-source` for each required source and each integrated craft reference actually used, using its repository-relative registered path. Do not add every optional source by default or claim that a PASS verifies the real loading history. Source attribution and the third-party notice are in [craft provenance](references/craft/PROVENANCE.md); this is not another instruction source to load for production.

Before any Framewright output, verify the current `version` value from the reference YAML and state exactly:

`Loaded: Framewright v<version>`

If the version or reference cannot be read, stop and explain the problem instead of using remembered or reconstructed rules.

Preserve the exact version value. Do not silently substitute a remembered, local-experimental, or older release.

## Workflow

1. Start each new compilation scope with the Unified Director Intake from the reference.
2. Present a compact understanding and production reading. Use the reference's Framewright-owned Intake Presentation Layer only to adapt language and proposal timing; it never selects Director Mode, state, questions, stage, target, or compiler ownership. Apply the relevant content review lens, classify material gaps, and schedule questions by dependency: ask only the highest-impact question when its answer can change later questions; combine only genuinely independent questions, with five retained as the maximum batch size.
3. Select exactly one Director Mode and state it explicitly to the user before compilation. Keep that mode in internal compile state, but never serialize its literal label into a clean model-facing Prompt.
4. After each dependent answer, update the Production Spine's nested Intent Ledger and recalculate the question queue. Protect intentional freedom, omit low-impact decoration, and stop when remaining gaps cannot materially change a downstream contract.
5. Identify the active production's single persistence owner. Reuse a reliable host-project authority record when one already exists; otherwise create or update the conditional `framewright_state.yaml` fallback only at the Core's durable checkpoint triggers. Reconcile only affected current fields with the latest explicit user decision and active artifacts; never duplicate the same truth across several state files or treat persistence as a second Production Spine or target-model input.
6. Treat requested advice or delegated judgment as a named, current-scope authority grant. Record material assumptions and continue only within that grant unless an explicit safety, reference-authority, generation-unit, stage, or feasibility decision still requires the user.
7. Before Video Prompt, resolve the current generation unit's Storyboard Preflight decision. After the Committed Shot Spine is current, resolve one generation strategy: one continuous shot, one edited multi-shot sequence, or one active shot at a time.
8. Run exactly one selected stage: Storyboard, Keyframes, or Video Prompt.
9. When the user approves the current plan and asks to compile, cross the Core Approved Compile Boundary: compile the approved Spine without reopening creative exploration, asking preference questions, or restating already resolved decisions. Ask only when one real blocker prevents a faithful artifact.
10. For Video Prompt, build and validate one approved model-neutral Prompt IR, resolve `target_model`, scalar `serialization_owner`, adapter contract, and compiler instruction sources from the registry, then let the selected adapter serialize that IR. Validate the actual `.txt` artifact with the bundled ownership-aware `video-prompt` command. When material performance or authorized vocal additions are active, pass a temporary current-scope compile trace with `--trace` so protected final-text spans, event content, count, and silence boundaries are checked against the exact saved prompt. The trace is diagnostic, not a second default output file; a valid field without a matching final clause is not a pass. For Storyboard, Shot Plate, or Keyframe, resolve one registered image creator or editor by artifact kind and operation, compile only the allowed scope, and validate the clean prompt with the image registry. In every stage, run the applicable Semantic Preflight checks, preserve the user's creative intent, and distinguish locked facts, approved decisions, reasonable execution inference, and intentional freedom.
11. Return the compact assistant-facing Intent Delta required by the reference, outside the clean prompt and without creating a second default artifact.
12. For a resolved Storyboard stage only, generate exactly one initial storyboard board image from the saved prompt as part of the same stage delivery package.

## Tool boundary

Default to one saved prompt artifact for the active stage. A conditionally triggered `framewright_state.yaml` is a project control file, not a second prompt artifact. For a requested Framewright compilation, creating or updating those authorized files is part of normal compilation after the intake, stage, reference, and generation-unit boundary gates have been satisfied. The resolved Storyboard stage also includes its one initial board image under the narrow exception below; none of these actions requires a second file-creation authorization.

Do not recreate retired workflow tiers, speed-versus-quality choices, paired-output shortcuts, or an all-output command. Complete one stage at a time and wait for an explicit request before starting another stage.

Do not invoke ChatCut, OpenMontage, video generation, modify non-Framewright files, or use another production tool unless the user explicitly asks for that additional action. The sole default generation exception is the resolved Storyboard stage's one initial board image after `prompt_storyboard.txt` is saved.

Do not automatically retry a failed storyboard generation, regenerate after revising its prompt, create a variant, generate a keyframe image, or generate video. Each of those actions requires fresh explicit authorization. A generated storyboard remains planning-only and must not be attached to a video job unless the user explicitly admits it as a runtime structural reference.

When Keyframes or Video Prompt is active, save the required `.txt` prompt files, return their paths with the compact assistant-facing handoff required by the reference, and stop. When Storyboard is active, return the saved prompt path and its one initial board result. Do not paste complete prompt bodies inline unless the user explicitly requests inline delivery or file writing is unavailable.
